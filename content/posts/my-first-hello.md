Hello, out there in the void! My name is James, and I’m a technology professional who has an insatiable passion for discussing technology. I firmly believe that technology has the power to enhance our lives, making them more beautiful, simple, and meaningful. However, I also have a critical perspective on how technology has impacted people my age, particularly in my areas of interest, and its broader effects on the daily lives of individuals worldwide. I would call myself a technology optimist, with a heavy dose of cynicism and skepticism when new items start rolling out. 

In my Codex of Minds, I aim to delve into and explain my unique perspectives on technology. While it’s true that the tech industry is filled with voices expressing expertise, I want to take a different approach. I want to share my knowledge and insights, but I won’t claim to be an expert. Instead, I view this as an opportunity for self-reflection and critical thinking.

So, what can I discuss? Well, as a consumer of technology rather than a reviewer, I believe it’s important to approach this topic with a balanced perspective. I’m an aspiring early adopter, but due to student loans, I’ll keep that aspiration for now. Before criticizing others’ devices and services, I prefer to critically evaluate my own. Additionally, I have a strong academic background in UI/UX, Network Theory, and Data Analytics. These skills are all instrumental in my current role as a pseudo-governance IT Project Manager, which means my days are spent building reports and exploring ways to improve processes and work within my company. 

Oh yeah, I do other things besides work and sit here philosophizing about technology. I’m a huge music listener; it’s the art I consume the most and love to engage with friends and family over. I’m also your typical nerd who loves playing board games of all kinds with my friends. And year-round, I’m always writing a new tabletop role-playing game series for us to enjoy! I’m a gym goer, so fitness technologies play a significant role in my life, but not as important as a good pair of headphones do for me. I’m also a lifelong student, both in practice and in title. I’ll be returning to school to continue becoming a stronger technologist, and all the while, I hope to broaden my horizons and learn as much as I can along the way!

So I cannot wait to kick start this exercise with one of my best friends from college, who has defiantly more technical prowess than I ever will! I am excited for us to collaborate and push our often aligned perspectives (with polarized approaches) to the written limits. I hope we can find some people out there who share our values, and hopefully give some curious people something new to consider!
