Hello, out there in the void! My name is James, and I'm a technology professional with a passion for discussing tech. I believe technology has the power to enhance our lives and that its hardware and services can be beautiful, simple, and meaningful. However, I also have a critical perspective on its impact on the world. I'd call myself a technology optimist with a heavy dose of cynicism and skepticism when new items start rolling out.

In my Codex of Minds, I aim to delve into and explain my unique perspectives on technology. While it’s true that the tech industry is filled with voices expressing expertise, I want to take a different approach. I want to share my knowledge and insights, but I won’t claim to be an expert. Instead, I view this as an opportunity for self-reflection and critical thinking.

My perspective is shaped by my professional and academic background in UI/UX, Network Theory, and Data Analytics. These skills are instrumental in my day-to-day role as an IT Project Manager, where I'm constantly exploring ways to improve processes.

But my life isn't all about work! I’m a huge music listener and a gym enthusiast, so fitness and audio technologies play a significant role in my life. I’m also a lifelong nerd who loves playing tabletop board games and is always in the perpetual stages of writing ttrpg sessions for my friends. I'm always a student, whether in practice or in title, and I plan to continue broadening my horizons and learning as much as I can along the way!

So I cannot wait to kick start this exercise with one of my best friends from college, who has definitely more technical prowess than I ever will. I cannot wait for us to collaborate and push our often aligned perspectives (with polarized approaches) to the limits. I hope we can find some people out there who share our values, and hopefully give some curious people something new to consider!
