## Hi there

My name is Liam and I'm the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

The theme includes:

- fully customizable color schemes generated by [**Terminal.css**](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/).
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice duotone**, custom syntax highlighting based on [**Chroma**](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) (fast, built-in Hugo syntax highlighter)
- fully responsive
- fully based on Hugo ecosystem (Pipes and Modules)

So, there you have it... enjoy!
